# BlackProduct.Review-backend

This is the backend project for BlackProduct.Review which utilizes DRF.  We will be using pip and
pyenv for this project due to deployment easibility.  Poetry is better for collaborative work, but pyenv 
best for deployment as Heroku has build packs that supplement pipenv, but not poetry. The endpoints all work,
but the front end is not finished.
